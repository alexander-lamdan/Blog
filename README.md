# Basic PHP Blog project
Welcome to my PHP Blog project on PHP OOP only.
Here I will try to improve my memory and knowledge on new stuff that added in last versions of PHP 8.2+.
The best way is to making something you know or better to know.

## Why blog?
Because in blogs you can make a lot of stuff that you don't do in day life.
You can create CMS in this blog, adding administration side for admins and other some fun stuff.

## Why PHP?
Why not? PHP is awesome language that I know good and better than front-end.

## What purpose of this project?
Nothing. Just refreshing my memory in development on PHP that I take 3-4 years not coding.
And making this as project for portfolio.

## What it will include? What kind of functionality?
- Auth management(Delete, update, create, block, freeze account)
- Changing profile and account information
- News feed as in VK/Facebook/Reddit
- Post with comments and reactions
- Admin management(Changing permissions to users, deleting users posts, reading logs and more)
- User management(Posts count, posts deleted, comments history and much more)
- Searching by tags, words or/and letter and date.
